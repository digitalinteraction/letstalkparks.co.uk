<p class="message"> &quot;We would need to clearly access figures necessary to maintain our parks and match income generation. One way we think parks could generate income though is through charging businesses who lead activities in parks (eg. bootcamps) as well as charge large business who need to offset their carbon credits as part of their corporate social responsibility for example. Parks could also generate income through a range of smaller activities (eg. weddings, food markets, festival etc.).&quot; —Workshop Team One  </p>

<p class="message"> &quot;Any commercial ventures must be in line with the trust’s values. Two areas of funding – market tourism and fundraising. The trust would need to employ full time fundraisers it would need to get the right people with the right skills. Another source of income generation could come from fining companies who pollute the water ways, also approach local companies to sponsor the parks but these companies needs to be selected appropriately (eg. not McDonalds, etc.). There should be a process of scrutiny of potential sponsors and donations.  Also, pop-up shops in parks could be a good source of income. &quot; —Workshop Team Two  </p>

<p class="message"> &quot;We need a regular and permanent source of money. There should be government funds/source/pot of money from the beginning. We are against the idea of a charitable trust running our parks. Taxation can and already is a way for fund-raising. It’s important to study successful and unsuccessful cases.&quot; — Workshop Team Two  </p>

<p class="message"> The money should come from the council and the council should be makinga much much bigger deal that this is happening as a result of the excessive and destructive cuts that are continuing and will continue. Public parks should not be used for advertising and it is shame that the councils only idea for development thruout the whol city seems to be...put a cafe on it...when obesity and litter and sustainability and environment is such a huge concern of the councils how can they not openly fight the government over cuts to public health and community spaces. Yes, events and certain paid access and sponsorship are all a good idea in the short term, faced with the immediate situation but whay legacy does it leave. The council should be more public and outraged that central governement ia forcing us to sell.off our public space and should seek to oppose it at every hurdle </p>

<p class="message"> This is my single biggest concern about the proposal. The monetisation of a natural space that is one of the only remaining spaces for all people to be without feeling like they need to pay money. Even if it is a charitable trust they will look for funding streams and that will include making the parks an income generator, which is fundamentally not what they should be. </p>

<p class="message"> Public funds for parks. <br />
One of the main roles of public funds is to take care of public spaces for public benefit. Parks are the very much important city spaces providing leisure spaces for communities. In our times when people living in the city, especially children and young people from poorer families and elderly people have hardly any contact with nature it&#039;s so vital to keep city parks flourish and to keep them quiet, free and recreation friendly and do not make another business opportunity of them. Apart from that when visitors come to any city the quality of the public environment, including parks and green spaces will be the one of the main features the city and the experience will be judge by.  And that means people will or will not come back to spend money in our city.  </p>

<p class="message"> I do not think parks have the capacity to raise the money needed for their upkeep, nor do I believe they should. Parks provide a very valuable service for people in terms of their health and well-being in addition to being spaces for leisure and recreation. For every pound spent on a park  the NHS saves in the region of £36.00. Governments (local and national) need to view parks as assets  not  liabilities and fund them accordingly. Deciding not to fund the parks has been a choice made by the Council and it is a mistake. Forcing parks to raise money on a large scale will create problems in terms of noise, conflicts of interest as well as constant disturbance for those people living nearby and will destroy the very benefits that parks have always provided. In an urban area where housing densities are increasing and fewer people have gardens sufficient in size to provide space for children to enjoy outdoor play, parks are becoming increasingly important. We live in a rich country and if we need to raise the money through local or national taxes then we need to do it. Perhaps the Council could also look into the possibility of using its huge reserves of money.<br />
Sheffield also looked at the idea of a Charitable Trust but has since decided to reject it and so should Newcastle. <br />
Making the environment one which looks well maintained and attractive is essential if we are to attract inward investment to the region. Newcastle and Gateshead have just won the bid to host the Great Exhibition of the North in 2018. This event worth millions to the area will concentrate on design, innovation and art in the North with the aim of showcasing the best the region can offer. It is expected to attract 3 million visitors and hopefully will transform perceptions of the North and encourage  inward investment. What hope do we have of making this a success when the Council cares so little for the way they maintain the physical environment?  </p>

<p class="message"> Living in close proximity to exhibition park, I have concerns about the events, virtually every weekend in the summer months there are events in the park. Great you might think, however the modern event comes with loud speakers and music which means that peace and quiet in our garden doesn&#039;t happen for most of the summer. I am all for events, however this problem needs addressing. The Brandling village residents association objected to the palace of the arts getting outdoor music and events space so that we didn&#039;t have to put up with noise. Any events in the park should take into account these issues and should include local residents associations in their plans. </p>

<p class="message"> Funding concerns - I&#039;m the secretary of the boat club at Paddy&#039;s and we have rented the boathouse from the council since it was built in 1928. The trust&#039;s remit is said to include all parks and allotments. My concern is that existing small tenants like us in the parks and allotments could find their rents jumping in an effort to raise the required funding. A significant rise in rent would probably finish us off, and I guess allotment holders would be in a similar position. </p>

<p class="message"> As Chair of Jesmond Community Orchard, I would love us to be involved in planting more fruit trees in selected park locations, and in holding events there such as Apple Days, pruning days or grafting courses.  There may be particular locations that would be ideal for creating new small orchards with the involvement of local people. </p>
